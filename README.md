# 2024-Preseason_YAGSL

*Formerly named "2024-reStormont"*

A spinoff of team 5409's robot code for [Stormont](https://github.com/FRC5409/2024-Stormont) but with swapped/modified motors, encoders, and motor controllers, and it can also play music.

The drivetrain uses YAGSL (Yet Another Generic Swerve Library), found [here](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL).

This repository is a pre-season project.
